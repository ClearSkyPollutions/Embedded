The stack.yml file configure two services : db and server
Each runs a single container, but may be upgraded if we need to scale.

Each service uses a named volume binding their log location to /home/msf/logs/[mysql or apache2]
A weekly backup of the database is done by archiving and compressing the volume db-data (/var/lib/docker/volumes/compose_db-data/_data)
	See "sudo crontab -l"

For docker-compose to run properly, it needs :
 - /home/msf/logs/mysql/
 - /home/msf/logs/apache2/
 - /home/msf/backup/
 - /home/msf/backup.sh

@TODO : 
 - Change backup.sh to use mysqldump instead of brute copying all mysql files
 - Change locations of the files ? (-> Embedded/Installation/compose ?)
